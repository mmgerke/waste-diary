        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Nowadays, we keep hearing about how bad the current state of the environment is: the global warming, the massive death of animals, air pollution and so on. The encouragement about using reused item or the recylable material gets spreaded more widely and widely. Although we have been informed a lot about this issues from the big scale level, and we thought we had enough motivations to make the world better, we have yet made an action. There is one small piece of information that we have not been discovered. The most realistic information than ever that would strongly change our behavior! Have you ever wondered? How much would a person's daily routine affect the environment? Or in another word, how much trash do you personally produce daily? Is it as you expect it?</p>
        <h5>Yes, we did wonder and we was <strong>surprised!</strong></h5>
        <p>Each of us conducted a small data collection of how much trash we would produce for a week. The purpose of this experiment is to help us gain cognition of our daily routined related to trash production and the effect of our trash contribution to the environment.
        </p>
        <p>Everytime we discard something, we took a picture and note about it. The information was what the item was, what it was made of, the discarded time, if it was recycled, and side note about why we used it. Each of us could took some other aspects into account regarding to our personal lives. For example, Maura differentiated the trash produced by her cat and herself; while Phuc focused on the amount of individual trash and if she did recycle it or not. The trash was categorized into 7 types: plastic, cardboard, paper, glass, aluminum, compost and trash.</p>

        <p>Each leaf represents a category that coded by color of the dot on the leaf tip. The flower is coded with the same concept by the color of the flower. Each flower represents a item that was put in the recycled bin. Each item which was thrown to trash can is illustrated by a hole on leaf as a caterpillar eats it.</p>
