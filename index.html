        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Nowadays, we keep hearing about how bad the current state of the environment is: global warming, the massive death of animals, air pollution and so on. The encouragement about reusing items or recylable materials has spread. Although we have been informed a lot about this issues on a large scale, and we thought we had enough motivation to make the world better, we have yet to act. There is one small piece of information that has not been discovered. The most realistic information than ever that would strongly change our behavior! Have you ever wondered? How much would a person's daily routine affect the environment? Or in another word, how much trash do you personally produce daily? Is it as much as you expect?</p>
        <h5>Yes, we did wonder and we were <strong>surprised!</strong></h5>
        <p>Each of us collected data of how much trash we produce for a week. The purpose of this experiment was to help us realize how much our daily routined produced trash and the effect of our trash contribution to the environment.
        </p>
        <p>Everytime we discarded something, we took a picture and note about it. The information was what the item was, what it was made of, the discarded time, if it was recycled, and side note about why we used it. Each of us could took some other aspects into account regarding to our personal lives. For example, Maura differentiated the trash produced by her cat and herself; while Phuc focused on the amount of individual trash and if she did recycle it or not. The trash was categorized into 7 types: plastic, cardboard, paper, glass, aluminum, compost and trash.</p>

        <h1>Total Waste Distribution</h1>
        <div>
          These bubbles represent the distribution of materials we disposed of over the week. Most of the waste we produced was non-recylable materials involved in eating or cleaning. This has shown us how much of a change it would make to stop using disposable plates, cups, and silverwear, and instead opt to dine in places.

        <h1>A Day in Waste</h1>
        <div>In a typical day, do you think about everytime you use a trash can? By tracking everything we disposed of over the week, we became much more concious of what we were throwing away. What was more interesting, is that we could track what we were doing throughout the day by when and what we disposed of. Here is Maura's typical day, as told in waste.

        <h1>Human vs. Cat</h1>
        <div>
        The biggest thing I didn't expect to learn from this experiment was how much waste taking care of my cat produces. She's old and set in her ways, and eats special prescription food because of a stomach issue. Between the  bag of cat litter every night and two to three cans of wet food a day, she was the cause of a large portion of my waste. When considering your impact on the enviornment, don't forget the impact of those you are resposible for caring for, like your pets.<p>

        <p>Each leaf represents a category coded by color of the dot on the leaf tip. The flower is coded with the same concept by the color of the flower. Each flower represents a item that was put in the recycled bin. Each item which was thrown to trash can is illustrated by a hole on leaf as a caterpillar eats it.</p>
